 Implement using linked-list:

- [x] push(value) - adds value at position at tail
- [x] pop() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
- [x] isEmpty()
- [ ] isFull() - only if using arrays 
- [x] peek() returns the object at the top of the stack without removing it from the stack or modifying the stack
- [x] size()
